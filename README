	Some analysis tools for UKESM - MEDUSA
	The bulk of the tools were written for the ERSEM model, then subsequently patched for performing analsysis of MEDUSA (or other iMarNet Models).
	
	
	
CONTENTS:
	analysis.py  
		Global plot that other plotting tools inherit from	
		
	cchl.py  
		Carbon to Chlorophyll ratio
		
	cchlvsIrradiance.py  
		Carbon:Chl ratio against Irradiance
		
	communityfit.py  
		Community Strcutre plotting
			
	pftnames.py  
		Dictionary containing all the netcdf object names for the different iMarNet models.
		
	testsuite.py  
		Code to run all tests in Series
		
	UKESMpython.py
		Toolkit containing many useful functions.

REQUIREMENTS:
	Python libraries:
	matplotlib, numpy, scipy,
	netCDF4
	
	communitystructure

TO DO:
	Analysis code Template
	Autoviv dict
	need to think of some clever ways to infer model name, date,jobID, etc.
	
	possibly move naming scheme into analysis template.
	 
	Move P2P code into this directory.
	
	Make list of required local/PML repositories
