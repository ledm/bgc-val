	Some analysis tools for UKESM - MEDUSA/ERSEM/NEMO 
	The bulk of the tools were written for the ERSEM model, then subsequently patched for performing analsysis of MEDUSA (or other iMarNet Models).
	
	There are two categories of analysis done here:
		1. Emergent property analysis
		2. Model vs data point to point comparison 

	The key files that do all the leg work are:
		    testsuite_emergence.py
		    testsuite_p2p.py
	They both run a selection of analsyes.
	
	
CONTENTS:

	analysis.py  
		Global plot that other plotting tools inherit from	

	pftnames.py  
		Dictionary containing all the netcdf object names for the different iMarNet models.
		
	testsuite.py  
		Code to run all tests in Series
		
	UKESMpython.py
		Toolkit containing many useful functions.

	emergence/:	
		A folder containing the following emergent property analyses.
		
		cchl.py  
			Carbon to Chlorophyll ratio
		
		cchlvsIrradiance.py  
			Carbon:Chl ratio against Irradiance
		
		communityfit.py  
			Community Strcutre plotting
	
	p2p/: 
		A folder containing the Point to point analsyes scritps (develop branch only).		
		
				
REQUIREMENTS:
	Python libraries:
	
	simple to install:
		pip install numpy scipy matplotlib netCDF4 pyyaml pyproj
		
		Harder to install:
			mpl_toolkits (needed for basemap, but has a new set of requirements)
			sudo apt-get install python-mpltoolkits.basemap
			sudo yum install python-mpltoolkits.basemap		
			or from source.
							
			It may be possible to switch casemap out for cartopy. I'm not sure.
					


			
			
		
		
	
	Code from :
	communitystructure 
		from: https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/ledm/communitystructure

	netcdf_manip:
		changeNC, mergeNC, pruneNC, convertToOneDNC
		from: https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/ledm/netcdf_manip
	
	PMLpython:
		from https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/momm/pml-python-tools
		some code uses ncdfView which a PML wrapper around netCDF4.Dataset.
		some code uses StatsDiagram, a Taylor/Target diagram routine in PMLpython.
		some code uses C2chl.py

		These resources are availalbe to all registered users on the gitlab server.
	
	
	
TO DO:
	Replace pftnames.getlongname with something better.

	add some better "alwaysInclude" methods to netcdf_manip
	
	more documentation.
	
	possibly move naming scheme into analysis template.

	Move the NameTypes (ie GEOTRACESTypes) into the getmt?
	
	Target diagrams:
		the same file name is copied multiple times
		different symbols are used in legend to the plot.
	
	
	Check requirements for local/PML repositories
		move those into this repository?
		remove ncdfView
		remove StatsDiagram
		relocate C2chl
