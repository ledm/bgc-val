README:
	Some analysis tools for UKESM - MEDUSA
	The bulk of the tools were written for the ERSEM model, then subsequently patched for performing analsysis of MEDUSA (or other iMarNet Models).
	
	
	
CONTENTS:

	analysis.py  
		Global plot that other plotting tools inherit from	

	pftnames.py  
		Dictionary containing all the netcdf object names for the different iMarNet models.
		
	testsuite.py  
		Code to run all tests in Series
		
	UKESMpython.py
		Toolkit containing many useful functions.

	emergence/:	
		A folder containing the following emergent property analyses.
		
		cchl.py  
			Carbon to Chlorophyll ratio
		
		cchlvsIrradiance.py  
			Carbon:Chl ratio against Irradiance
		
		communityfit.py  
			Community Strcutre plotting
	
	p2p/: 
		A folder containing the Point to point analsyes scritps (develop branch only).		
		
				
REQUIREMENTS:
	Python libraries:
	matplotlib, numpy, scipy,
	netCDF4
	
	communitystructure 
		from: https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/ledm/communitystructure

TO DO:
	Analysis code Template
	Autoviv dict
	need to think of some clever ways to infer model name, date,jobID, etc.
	
	possibly move naming scheme into analysis template.
	 
	Move P2P code into this repository.
	
	
	Check requirements for local/PML repositories
		move those into this repository?
